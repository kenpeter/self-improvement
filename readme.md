# Intro

Here is a list of TED talks, tips, ideas that really help myself to improve.

I was at the bottom of school and even after I start working as a professional. I still felt that I was the bottom of the food chain.
One day, I start to make real change. I learned different study techniques and applied them to my work. I practise meditation and use it
in my day to day life. I had overcome my problem and become successful.

If I can do it, you can do it too. In my final words, "We are all equally smart and it is just a matter of strategy".
